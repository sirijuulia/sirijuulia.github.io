            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am a dabbler in creative pursuits. 
                I use creativity to make sense of the world, to pay attention, 
                to find and use my voice in a noisy world. 
                At the moment, I mostly write and take photos and work on creative recovery. 
                I also enjoy trying my hand in crafts that I’m woefully rubbish at, 
                such as pottery and modern dance. Being bad at things brings me great joy. 
              <br><br>I’ve set up this website to record my thoughts, my creations, my process – 
                I’m feeling very much at a start of a journey 
                but it feels important to be present in the world from the beginning. 
              <br><br>You can also find my photos on 
              Facebook at <a href='https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61555273284524'>Siri Juulia Photography</a>; 
              and my poems on Instagram at <a href='https://www.instagram.com/crossroadspoetry/'>@Crossroadspoetry</a>. 
              <br><br>Below you can drop me a message or sign up to hear about any new projects.
